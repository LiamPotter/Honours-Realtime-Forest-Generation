EASY CHARACTER MOVEMENT
=======================

CHANGE LOG

Version 1.4.4

	*** MAJOR UPDATE, BREAKING CHANGES. PLEASE BACKUP BEFORE UPDATE.

	- Major update, the whole package has been refactored and restructured to be much more organized and easier to work with.

	- NEW physical model, greatly improved movement physics adding friction, this helps to achive a much more responsive control
	  even at low acceleration values.

	- Improved BaseCharacterController, this has been refactored making it much more robust and easier to extend.

	- Introduced 2 new base controllers, 'BaseAgentController' and 'BaseFirstPersonController'.

	- 'BaseAgentController' new base controller for NavMeshAgent based characters.

	- 'BaseFirstPersonController' new base controller for First Person character controller.

	- New examples to show how to work with the new included controllers.

	- Improved and more extensive documentation.

	- Removed the use / requirement of Resources folder.

	- Revised / optimized code, and improved in-code comments and tooltips.


Version 1.3

	- Improved jump physics. In the new method, we apply a proportional extra jump power (acceleration) to perform variable height jump,
	  this offers a better jump control and removes any floaty jetpack feel.

 	- Added a new maxRiseSpeed property to CharacterMovement component. This helps to limit the maximum rising velocity along y+ axis.

 	- Added tooltips to main components, this helps to tweak its values without the need to look in documents / code.

 	- ECM now belongs to the Scripting/Physics asset store category. This removes the "one license per seat" restriction imposed to editor extensions.


Version 1.2

	- Added a jump tolerance time property to base character controller.
	  This helps to manage how early before hitting the ground you can press jump, and still perform the jump.

	- Added a new Raycast ground detection component.

	- Added a CustomCharacterController example.
	  This shows how to create a custom character controller to perform the movement relative to camera.

	- Fixed a minor bug where some of the controllers were not applying braking drag.


Version 1.1

	- Fixed a minor bug related to demo scene lightmap size.

	- Added a simple demos scene, to faster start.

	- Exposed all ground info from movement component.
	
	- Improved character braking, braking is composed of friction (velocity-dependent drag) and constant deceleration.


VERSION 1.0

	- Initial release.
